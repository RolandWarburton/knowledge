# OpenAPI and Swagger

OpenAPI is a YAML and JSON standard for standardizing APIs. Swagger developed the OpenAPI standard for public use and makes money by developing tools for generating OpenAPI spec files.

OpenAPI resources that i looked at for setting up API documentation.

* [Swagger UI Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) To serve the swagger UI based on an OpenAPI spec.
* [Swagger JSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc) To convert jsdoc comments into an OpenAPI spec.
* [Swagger Inspector](https://inspector.swagger.io) Create OpenAPI definitions semi-automatically through HTTP requests and analysing the response.
* [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/) A paid for (with a free tier) tool for graphically creating an OpenAPI spec.

## Setting up Swagger UI Express

We will add a new step in `app.ts` that initializes Swagger. Make sure to place the docs before the routes initializers to fix any routing issues.

```ts
import openApiSettings from "./openApiSettings";
// eslint-disable-next-line node/no-unpublished-import
import swaggerUi from "swagger-ui-express";
// eslint-disable-next-line node/no-unpublished-import
import swaggerJsdoc from "swagger-jsdoc";

class App {
  public app: express.Application;
  public port: string | number;
  public env: boolean;

  constructor(routes: Route[]) {
    this.app = express();
    this.port = process.env["PORT"] || 3000;
    this.env = process.env["NODE_ENV"] === "production" ? true : false;

    this.initializeMiddlewares();
    this.initilizeDocs(); // <-- Add this
    this.initializeRoutes(routes);
    this.initializeErrorHandling();
  }

  // Create the swagger UI for openapi documentation
  // This step MUST come before the initialize routes
  private initilizeDocs() {
    // use swagger-jsdoc to get openapi scheme
    const openapiSpecification = swaggerJsdoc(openApiSettings);

    // or import an openapi spec
    // const fs.readFileSync("../swagger.json", {format: "utf-8"})

    this.app.use("/api", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(openapiSpecification));
  }

}
```

## Using a Vanilla Swagger Spec JSON

If we were not relying on swagger-jsdoc to generate our spec file based on route comments. We instead must just load in a `swagger.json` we wrote ourselves (see below).

**However** there is a better way! By using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/) you can graphically and much easily create spec files and generate documentation much faster thanwriting by hand. Also OpenAPI is the biggest waste of time to manually write because its complicated, long-winded, and barely designed for human readability in my opinion.

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.3",
  "info": {
    "description": "My Example App",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "title": "Example App",
    "contact": {
      "name": "Roland",
      "email": "abc@gmail.com"
    }
  },
  // etc etc
  "paths": {
    "/todos": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Get all the tasks",
        "description": "Get all the tasks",
        "produces": ["application/json"],
        "parameters": [],
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "successful operation",
            "schema": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "$ref": "#/definitions/todosResponse"
              }
            }
          },
          "400": {
            "description": "Invalid status value",
            "schema": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/InvalidResponse"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Swagger JSDoc

### RECOMMENDED TO SKIP THIS

**NOTE** I decided not to use Swagger-JSDoc because i was not able to get *"Components"* and *"$ref"* working with the plugin.

Here is what `openApiSettings.ts` looks like, we load this in as a base config for swagger-jsdoc.

```ts
export default {
  definition: {
    openapi: "3.0.1",
    info: {
      title: "Hello World",
      version: "1.0.0",
    },
  },
  tags: [
    {
      name: "users",
      description: "operations available to everyone",
    },
  ],
  servers: [
    {
      url: "localhost:3000/api",
      description: "development server",
      variables: {
        port: {
          default: "3000",
        },
      },
      basePath: {
        default: "v1",
      },
    },
    {
      url: "example.rolandw.dev/api",
      description: "Production server",
      variables: {
        port: {
          enum: ["443", "80"],
          default: "443",
        },
      },
      basePath: {
        default: "v1",
      },
    },
  ],
  host: "localhost:3080",
  basePath: "/api",
  apis: ["**/routes/*.ts"],
};
```

Next we use `@openapi` yaml in each of our routes for swagger-jsdoc to collect and use to create the full spec.

```ts
// /src/routes/index.route.ts

import { Router } from "express";
import IndexController from "../controllers/index.controller";
import Route from "../interfaces/routes.interface";

/**
 * @openapi
 * /:
 *   get:
 *     summary: returns root with help
 *     description: returns root with help
 *     tags:
 *       - users
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: Returns a mysterious string.
 *         content:
 *           application/json:
 */
class IndexRoute implements Route {
  public path = "/";
  public router = Router();
  public indexController = new IndexController();

  constructor() {
    this.initializeRoutes();
  }

  private initializeRoutes() {
    this.router.get(`${this.path}`, this.indexController.index);
  }
}

export default IndexRoute;
```
