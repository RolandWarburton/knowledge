# OpenAPI Practical Example

After downloading the stoplight app and taking a look at the example project. Lets remove all that and start by creating a new spec first, then implement it into our express app.

For example lets create a request that can be describes as follows:

* The request is a POST to the "/user" endpoint
* The request body must by "application/json"
* This request should be tagged with "general" because its general use (tags just group requests together in documentation)
* The request body must contain an "id" property containing a number
* The response body must by "application/json"
* The response body for HTTP 200 must contain an "id: number", "name: string", and "likes: string" property

This whole process is pretty self explanatory apart from resolving these errors for tagging.

* Operation should have non-empty `tags` array.
* Operation tags should be defined in global tags.

![errors picture](https://i.imgur.com/H1mCHUY.png)

To resolve this use the "tag button" on both the request you are creating, and the "api overview" itself.

* By adding the tag to the "api overview" you are adding it to a global tag list that describes all the possible tags. This resolves the `Operation tags should be defined in global tags` error.
* By adding the tag to the specific "/user" request you are resolving the `Operation should have non-empty tags array` error.

Here is a photo of the request in the GUI. Notice how i used a "model" for the response. OpenAPI supports components like models that allow for code reuse.

Heres a photo of the model.

And finally just in case, heres the fully generated spec for easy use.

}
```

To use this with Swagger UI Express all we need to do is export this json in a ts file (so it is compiled into the dist folder).

```ts
// app.ts

// import the swagger.ts file exporting the spec above
import openapiSpecification from "./swagger";
import { OpenAPIV3 } from "openapi-types";

class App {
  // ...

  // Create the swagger UI for openapi documentation
  // This step MUST come before the initialize routes
  private initilizeDocs() {
    // or import an openapi spec (my preferred method) by importing the full doc
    this.app.use(
      "/api",
      swaggerUi.serve,
      swaggerUi.setup(openapiSpecification as OpenAPIV3.Document)
    );
  }
}
```

Next lets see what codegen we can make using Swagger Hub Codegen. Convert the JSON from Stoplight into YAML, paste it into the editor, and generate some JS code.

```output
.
├── api
│   └── openapi.yaml
├── controllers
│   └── General.js
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── service
│   └── GeneralService.js
└── utils
    └── writer.js

4 directories, 7 files
```

I wont even post the generated code here because i have learnt that it does not do a very good job for typescript projects. After all its not even TS generated code (its vanilla JS). To be fair i did not expect a one click solution that automatically programs the entire API because thats nigh impossible.

TLDR this code looks very bare-bones, thats because it is. It seems that swagger-codegen has barely interpreted our spec. So we should definitely not be relying on this tool for any actual programming. Instead lets implement the `/user/:id` endpoint ourselves.

First we need to define the request shape in `src/models/requests/user_id.ts`.

The request will use a custom type created first called *UserRequest*, and *JSONSchemaType* takes that *UserRequest*.

The purpose of a JSONSchemaType from AJV is to allow a typescript safe schema for AJV to read later (in other words it would be a vanilla object in normal JS). The *JSONSchemaType* ensures that we have properties like the ajv "type" and "properties" field.

Using the "UserRequest" as a generic for "JSONSchemaType", we can also ensure that the "properties" contains only expected fields supported by the "UserRequest" type.

```ts
// src/models/requests/user_id.ts

import { JSONSchemaType } from "ajv";

type UserRequest = {
  id: string;
};

// the "UserRequest" of type JSONSchemaType<UserRequest> is used by JSONSchemaType as a "generic"
// A generic is a way of capturing a user passed in Type (<UserRequest>) that JSONSchemaType can use internally.
// JSONSchemaType will be defined in the Ajv library as something like `interface JSONSchemaType<Type> {...}`
// 		Now JSONSchemaType can use the <UserRequest> type. EG. interface JSONSchemaType<Type> { myArg: Type }
// You can also use generics for functions and classes https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html
const schema: JSONSchemaType<UserRequest> = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    id: { type: "string", nullable: false },
  },
  required: ["id"],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

// We can now use this schema in the middleware of routes/user.route.ts to validate that a user request is an object that matches...
// {
//  id: string
// }
export default schema;
export { UserRequest };
```

And a model for our response as well. We will just use it to store our "database" of users.

```ts
// src/models/responses/user.ts

import Ajv, { JSONSchemaType } from "ajv";

// interface for implementation of the User object
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  likes: string;
};

// type guard checking for the user object
const ajv = new Ajv();

const schema: JSONSchemaType<User> = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    id: { type: "string", nullable: false },
    name: { type: "string", nullable: false },
    likes: { type: "string", nullable: false },
  },
  required: ["id", "name", "likes"],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

const validateSchema = ajv.compile(schema);

export default User;
export { validateSchema };
```

Then lets create new middleware to assist in checking the body of the request has the shape we specified in the OpenAPI GUI creator.

Here we will implement our own generic `<Type>` to accept a `value` of a "body", "query", or "param". And a validation function of type `ValidateFunction<Type>` provided by AJV, the `<Type>` that we call the validationMiddleware with will be substituted into `ValidateFunction<Type>`.

For example if we called `validationMiddleware<UserRequest>` then the validation function would be `ValidateFunction<UserRequest>`.

```ts
// src/middleware/validateReq.middleware.ts

import { NextFunction, Request, Response, RequestHandler } from "express";
import { ValidateFunction } from "ajv";
import HttpException from "../exceptions/HttpException";

type Value = "body" | "query" | "params";

// when we call this we need to tell it the type for the validate function
// for example in user.route.ts: `validateRequest<UserRequest>("params", new Ajv().compile(mySchema);)`
function validationMiddleware<Type>(
  value: Value,
  validate: ValidateFunction<Type>
): RequestHandler {
  // This is sort of like a factory pattern that returns some middleware function that can validate any <Type> of schema passed to it.
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // run a validation check of the request ("body"/"query"/"params") against the schema we gave it
    if (validate(req[value])) next();
    else next(new HttpException(400, `wrong body from validate middleware`));
  };
}

export default validationMiddleware;
```

Lastly lets create a simple "user lookup" route and its controller to handle some simple request that relies on a `req.body.params.id` to be present.

```ts
// src/routes/user.route.ts

// This is just ONE route. A new file is created for every route
// The Route contains an userController which is a standard-ish MVC controller
// 		The job for userController is to actually run some code for the request

import { Router } from "express";
import UserController from "../controllers/user.controller";
import Route from "../interfaces/routes.interface";
import userRequestSchema, { UserRequest } from "../models/requests/user_id";
import validateRequest from "../middleware/validateReq.middleware";
import Ajv from "ajv";

// The "userRequestSchema" is a JSONSchemaType for AJV to consume
// The UserRequest is a typescript <Type> for JSONSchemaType

// We need "userRequestSchema" object to compile the AJV validator function
// We need "UserRequest" type to tell the validateRequest middleware
//    what type the validate function should use

class UserRoute implements Route {
    public path = "/user/:id";
    public router = Router();
    public controller = new UserController();
    private validator = new Ajv().compile(userRequestSchema);

    constructor() {
        this.initializeRoutes();
    }

    private initializeRoutes() {
        this.router.get(
            `${this.path}`,
            validateRequest<UserRequest>("params", this.validator),
            this.controller.user
        );
    }
}

export default UserRoute;
```

And our controller that handles our route.

```ts
// user.route.ts

// This file is a controller that runs some code when a route is hit
// This file is referenced by the user.route.ts ROUTE which uses UserController (this) as its CONTROLLER

import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from "express";
import HttpException from "../exceptions/HttpException";
import User from "../models/responses/user";

class UserController {
    public user = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): void => {
        // Define status for the HTTP request to be sent later
        // our user database
        const users: Array<User> = [
            {
                id: "1",
                name: "roland",
                likes: "chocolate",
            },
        ];

        // by the time this controller is called we expect that the values passed in have been validated
        // 		so we can put some very simple logic in here to just find the user and return them
        // if the user is 404 then we send next() a HttpException and Express will pass that to the error middleware
        // 		because HttpException is an Error (extends the error class)
        try {
            const user = users.find((user) => user.id == req.params["id"]);
            if (!user) {
                res.status(404);
                next(new HttpException(404, "user not found"));
            } else {
                res.status(200);
                res.json(user);
            }

            // set the status
        } catch (error) {
            // the HTTP exception middleware will read this even if its a standard Error and not a HttpException
            // then if its NOT a HTTP exception it just gets passed along the chain, to either express to handle the error,
            // 		or if you enable the general Error (Error class) middleware, then this will handle it instead.
            next(error);
        }
    };
}

export default UserController;
```

Ok great! Now we have achieved the following things in summary.

1. We created a model of our request
2. We created middleware to validate our request
3. We created a new route that uses provides our model to the validate middleware
4. Our route returns a User object based on our defined model

## Unit and Intergration tests

So far we have written only unit tests. That is that we test just a controller, or a route on its own. But in the real application there is a flow to the code. EG...

* A route is created, **then**
* The route has, and calls its middleware, **then**
* A route calls its controller, **then**
* The controller calls its own ExpressJS next() function, **then**
* The next() function continues to pass the the request/response object down the chain until eventually the client gets a response of some kind

Each one of these dot points can (and should) be tested individually (even next(), by checking it was called by the controller with specific parameters etc).

**(Important)** Because we can only test one unit of code at a time, it is hard to test an entire lifecycle of the request/response for a particular route because we would need to
mock every next() call and that would be tedious and wasteful of our time.

This is what intergration testing aims to solve by combining two "units" of code together.

I like to think about the testing ecosystem within the architecture of C4. The intergration of units come together to form "components". Then we can slot these components together to compose our full application or container. And finally this container of software can make up and ecosystem or "software system".

### The Rest of The Testing Types

Based on [atlassion] there are also other types of tests that you could research and implement into your software.

* Unit Tests (done)
* Intergration tests (done)
* Functional Tests - Tests that assess business level input and output
* End-to-End Tests - Replicate user behavior in a browser (or whatver the user sees/uses)
* Acceptance Tests - A business checklist to verify business requirements are met
* Performance Tests - Benchmarking software speed and performance

## Unit tests for the User Route

Ok lets also write some unit tests to cover this code.

```ts
import UserController from "../controllers/user.controller";
import User from "../models/responses/user";
import HttpException from "../exceptions/HttpException";
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

describe("Test the user controller", () => {
  let mockRequest: Partial<Request>;
  let mockResponse: Partial<Response>;
  let nextFunction: Partial<NextFunction>;

  let resultJson = {};
  let resultStatus = {};

  // This is the same boilerplate that i explained above
  beforeEach(() => {
    // reset the request and response objects before each test
    mockRequest = {};
    mockResponse = {};

    // reset the objects that store results in them
    resultJson = {};
    resultStatus = {};

    // mock the response status
    mockResponse.status = jest.fn().mockImplementation((result) => {
      resultStatus = result;
      return mockResponse;
    });

    // mock the response response
    mockResponse.json = jest.fn().mockImplementation((result) => {
      resultJson = result;
      return mockResponse;
    });

    nextFunction = jest.fn();
  });

  it("returns returns user object", () => {
    const controller = new UserController().user;

    // input to the controller
    mockRequest.params = { id: "1" };

    // expected response
    const expected: User = { id: "1", name: "roland", likes: "chocolate" };

    // run the controller method
    controller(mockRequest as Request, mockResponse as Response, nextFunction as NextFunction);

    // when the res.status is called we expect it to be passed 200
    expect(resultStatus).toBe(200);

    // expect the response to be this user
    expect(resultJson).toEqual(expected);
  });

  it("returns user not found error", () => {
    const controller = new UserController().user;

    // input to the controller
    mockRequest.params = { id: "not a user" };

    // run the controller method
    controller(mockRequest as Request, mockResponse as Response, nextFunction as NextFunction);

    // when the res.status is called we expect it to be passed 200
    expect(resultStatus).toBe(404);

    // expect the response to be empty (IE not modified by the mock)
    expect(Object.entries(resultJson).length).toBe(0);

    // expect the response.json to NOT have been called (by checking is mock properties)
    expect(mockResponse.json).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);

    // expect the next middleware to have been called due to the user not being found
    expect(nextFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

    // expect that the next middleware was called with this error
    expect(nextFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith(new HttpException(404, "user not found"));
  });

  // Note that this logically should not happen because there is no route to the controller that allows no user to be passed
  //      as /user/:id requires a parameter to be set (otherwise the path is just /user)
  // Its up to you if you want to write these tests to handle future situations
  //      when you might decide to implement a route that will practically use this test
  test("nothing is passed", () => {
    const controller = new UserController().user;

    // input to the controller
    mockRequest.params = {};

    // run the controller method
    controller(mockRequest as Request, mockResponse as Response, nextFunction as NextFunction);

    // when the res.status is called we expect it to be passed 200
    expect(resultStatus).toBe(404);
  });
});
```

And then some intergration tests using [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) as an agent to run the server in memory and make requests against it, asserting that collections of routes (the /user/:id route) and controllers (the user controller) act correctly as a whole.

```ts
// src/__tests__/intergrations/user.controller.ts

// eslint-disable-next-line node/no-unpublished-import
import supertest, { SuperTest, Request } from "supertest";
import App from "../../app";
import UserRoute from "../../routes/user.route";
import PageNotFoundRoute from "../../routes/pageNotFound.route";
import { validateSchema as validateUser } from "../../models/responses/user";

describe("user intergrations", () => {
  const routes = [new UserRoute(), new PageNotFoundRoute()];
  const app = new App(routes);
  const server = app.getServer();
  const request: SuperTest<Request> = supertest(server);

  test("The user is returned when requested", async () => {
    const response = await request.get("/user/1");
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.header["content-type"]).toBe("application/json; charset=utf-8");

    // validate the response equals what we expected
    expect(response.body).toEqual({ id: "1", name: "roland", likes: "chocolate" });

    // validate the response against the model to ensure the model is correct
    expect(validateUser(response.body)).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test("Where user does not exist return 404 user not found", async () => {
    const requests = ["/user/not found", "/user/-1", "/user/99999"];
    for await (const r of requests) {
      const response = await request.get(r);
      expect(response.status).toBe(404);
      expect(response.header["content-type"]).toBe("application/json; charset=utf-8");
      expect(response.body).toEqual({ message: "user not found" });
    }
  });

  test("No id param returns 404 page not found", async () => {
    const response = await request.get("/users/");
    expect(response.status).toBe(404);
    expect(response.header["content-type"]).toBe("application/json; charset=utf-8");
    expect(response.body).toEqual({ message: "Page not found" });
  });
});
```
