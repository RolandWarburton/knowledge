# Unit Testing

## Jest Tooling

I've had **MAJOR** issues getting the VSC jest plugin working. Instead of relying on an plugin for VSC i just use `jest --watch` to watch for new tests compared to previous commit, or `jest --watchAll` to watch all my tests from a terminal. I Always have a separate (not VSC intergrated) terminal open next to my project because it spreads out information across the screen.

## Mocking Controllers


Lets walk through some basic unit tests for the following controller.

```ts
class IndexController {
  public index = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): void => {
    try {
      // check if there was a .error field in the request body
      if (!req?.body?.error) {
        res.status(200).json({ hello: "world" });
      } else {
        next(new HttpException(500, "you messed up"));
      }
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);
    }
  };
}
```

Here are the unit tests to just assert test the basic functionality of the above controller.

* We get 200 status back and a JSON object that contains expected data.
* We can call the `next()` middleware function on an error.
* We do not throw an error when passing JSON in the Request body.

With these simple tests you should be able to research and develop future actual practical tests for a real application.

```ts
import IndexController from "../controllers/index.controller";
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

describe("test", () => {
  // declare these partials outside of the test scope so they are available within the closure of the test at all times.
  // A partial is a typescript feature that means the mocked object will be a subset of the object it is pretending to be
  // 		Later on when we pass the mockRequest and mockResponse to the controller we coerce them into their
  // 		type using the (mockRequest as Request), "as" keyword so the controller is happy with the types
  let mockRequest: Partial<Request>;
  let mockResponse: Partial<Response>;
  let nextFunction: Partial<NextFunction>;

  // we also create these objects to store the result of the .status and .json that express gives to us when we mock
  // 		the implementation of the .status and .json functions that exist inside the controller
  let resultJson = {};
  let resultStatus = {};

  beforeEach(() => {
    // reset the request and response objects before each test
    mockRequest = {};
    mockResponse = {};

    // reset the objects that store results in them
    resultJson = {};
    resultStatus = {};

    // The mockImplementation catches the .status function when it is called in express,
    // 	then runs the below test code to "implement" what the function will do.
    //
    // To test express there is a special requirement, that is to return the "mockResponse" object every time,
    // 		this mimics the "function chaining" behavior of express where we call .status().json({}) in the controller
    //
    // the .mockImplementation((result) => {} "result" variable is given to us by express and represents
    // 		what the controller and express passed to the .status and .json parts of the chain,
    // 		essentially we just steal that and keep it for our assertions later on in the test
    mockResponse.status = jest.fn().mockImplementation((result) => {
      resultStatus = result;
      return mockResponse;
    });

    mockResponse.json = jest.fn().mockImplementation((result) => {
      resultJson = result;
      return mockResponse;
    });

    // Create a jest function that we can pass as the nextFunction to the controller
    // 		If the controller reaches an error state, then the next() function will be called
    // 		and we will be able to assert that by calling the .toHaveBeenCalledTimes() method
    nextFunction = jest.fn();
  });

  it("returns 200 and the expected json body", () => {
    const controller = new IndexController().index;
    // run the index controller with the req of {} and wait for the response
    controller(mockRequest as Request, mockResponse as Response, nextFunction as NextFunction);

    // when the res.status is called we expect it to be passed 200
    expect(resultStatus).toBe(200);

    // when the res.json is called we expect it to have the body json from the controller
    expect(resultJson).toEqual({ hello: "world" });
  });

  it("calls the next function when the json body.error field is passed to it", () => {
    const controller = new IndexController().index;

    mockRequest.body = { error: "please" };
    controller(mockRequest as Request, mockResponse as Response, nextFunction as NextFunction);

    // check that the next function has been called
    expect(nextFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });

  it("does not throw an error when json is passed to it", () => {
    const controller = new IndexController().index;

    mockRequest.body = { noError: "please" };
    controller(mockRequest as Request, mockResponse as Response, nextFunction as NextFunction);

    // check that the next function has been called
    expect(nextFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);
  });
});
```

Lets look at the beginning of the suite. A `Partial` is a typescript feature that allows us to say "this object will contain a subset a class".

* A partial of a `Request` and `Response` from express will be used to mock the req and res
* We will also create a `next` function thats a partial of NextFunction from express

The last line `jest.fn()` is a mock function, think of jest.fn as wrapping the function in jest to let you make queries about the state of that function when it is called, for example what arguments was passed to it `next.mock.calls[0]`, and how many times it was called in the function that you are testing `next.mock.calls.length`.

```ts
describe("test", () => {
  let mockRequest: Partial<Request>;
  let mockResponse: Partial<Response>;
  const nextFunction: Partial<NextFunction> = jest.fn();
```

# A bit More on Mocking Implementations

The purpose of `jest.fn()` is to create a function that we can mock by exposing parts of the application controller to our test.
In the simple example where we call .mockImplementation we are literally adding an extra hidden step that the regular express controller does not see, in other words the real express `.status()` is called, our `jest.fn().mockImplementation` is also called and is passed the exact same data that the real `.status()` is, therefore allowing us to steal or spy on the data coming from the controllers method.

Also for the record a mocked/mock function == function spies as far as jest is concerned.

```ts
mockResponse.functionWeWantToReturn = jest.fn().mockImplementation((result) => {
  // We have some logic here for our test that has access to the `result` that the real controller
  // passed to the .functionWeWantToReturn method.

  // In this case we want to just capture the result passed to us
  resultStatus = result;

  // Also we need to add this line to the test mocked implementation
  //    because it needs to mock how the real express controller actually acts.
  //    The real express .functionWeWantToReturn method (think of .json or .status) are chained methods
  //    and a chain method returns itself through the chain, so thats what the below line does to make the test work.
  return mockResponse;
}
```

An alternate solution (that you should not use) is below. How this works (i think) is that instead of cracking open the entire function to write some code and steal the result from it we instead do these two things.

* We get the mockResponse (right hand side returned from express) and return it (to satisfy the chained nature of express)
* At the same time steal the .status from the and store it in our own (left hand side) `mockResponse.status` which works because before jest.fn() ran the real `express.status` ran and populated it with the correct status code.

The reason why **NOT** to use this code is because of the "recursive-ish" parameter passing, which makes it way more confusing than building a constant object in general.

```ts
//            because of express running before jest.fn this object already has .status in it
//                                                 |
mockResponse.status = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(mockResponse);
//             |
//          now we can steal what the mocked return value contains
//          and store it in our own local .status
```

## A bit More on Jest functions

Here is another simpler example using just `jest.fn()` by itself. In this example we convert a typed function into a jest wrapped function using `jest.fn`.

```ts
// the function we want to test
const foo = (): string => {
  return "hello roland";
};

// convert foo into mockedFoo
const mockedFoo = jest.fn(foo);

test("my mocked function", () => {
  // Run the function!
  const result = mockedFoo();

  // expect that it returned the string
  expect(result).toBe("hello roland");

  // expect that we called the function once
  expect(mockedFoo.mock.calls).toHaveLength(1);

  // This function was instantiated exactly once
  expect(mockedFoo.mock.instances.length).toBe(1);
});
```
