# Cable Standards

> Describing cable speeds, alternate ethernet transmission types, and explaining plenum/non plenum

## Plenum vs Non-Plenum

#### Plenum
Refers to the space in a building where the air circulation is free flow 
* A downside to this is that plenum spaces are more prone to fire 
* Cables that run through plenum spaces must meet requirements
  * Must be fire resistant cables
  * Must not produce toxic fumes when burned

#### Non-Plenum
Refers to the air ducts that encapsulates the air

## Alternate Methods of Transmitting Ethernet

### Ethernet over HDMI

![Powerline_Network_Adaptor](/media/HDMI_Cable.png)

* Uses the IEEE 1901-2013 standard 
* Available in HDMI 1.4 specification which adds an additional channel for network communication
* 100mp/s theoretical speeds

### Ethernet over powerline

* If WIFI or ethernet cable is unable to reach a location, Ethernet over powerline can be used
* Makes use of a powerline network adaptor which has a build in RJ-45 connector
* To set up you must plug the network adaptor from the router to the wall adapter then from the adapter to the computer on the other side

## Classifying Ethernet Cable Speeds With [X]BASE-T

![XBASEY](/media/XbaseY.png)

#### 10Base2
* "Thin internet" that uses coaxial cables
* Max length of 200m

#### 100BaseT
* Uses UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) CAT5 cable or higher
* Copper cable

#### 100Base-FX
* Fiber Optic cable
* Max length of 400m (half duplex) and 2 km (full duplex)

#### 1000Base-T
* Uses UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) CAT5 cable or higher
* Max length of 100m
* Uses 4 bi-directional wires

#### 1000Base-TX
* Similar to 1000Base-T
* Uses 2 unidirectional wires
* Never caught on (failed)

#### 10GBase-T
* Developed in 2006
* Uses both shielded and unshielded twisted pair cabling (STP / UTP)
* Max distance of 100 meters with cat6a cabling
* Max distance of 55 meters with cat6 cabling
