# Wireless Technologies

### IEEE

IEEE is an organization that develops and maintains standards related to electricity. They created the 802 standard. This doc will focus on the 802.11 standard which is the standard for wireless technology.

There are 5 wireless standards:
**a, b, g, n, and ac** which are summarized below.

|              | 802.11a | 802.11b | 802.11g | 802.11n      | 802.11ac   |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Speed        | 54 mbps | 11 mbps | 54 mbps | 600 mbps     | 6,933 mbps |
| Frequency    | 5 Ghz   | 2.4 Ghz | 2.4 Ghz | 2.4 or 5 Ghz | 5 Ghz      |
| Release Date | 1999    | 1999    | 2003    | 2009         | 2014       |

### Infrared

Infrared is a technology developed by IRDA (infrared data association.)
Infrared is a wireless technology where data is transmitted through invisible rays or light rather than radio waves.

* Infrared requires a direct line of sight
* Does not work in direct sunlight (weakens or blocks)

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a short range radio that provides a way to connect to (continuous connection) and exchange data between devices

* Operates at 2.4 Ghz
* Can transmit voice and data
* The most recent standard in bluetooth (BT 5) can transmit at 50mbps
* The most recent standard in bluetooth has a maximum distance of 240 meters
