# TNE30009 Net Sec Resilience
This unit covers threats to network security. Writing policy, and assessing different threats to a company and its network.

## Learning objectives
* Describing what security is concerned with
* The evolution of approaches to network security in the past
* Explain the role of a security policy in implementing appropriate security mechanisms
* Name the main technologies used in implementing a security policy

# Unit concepts

## Examples of attacks
* Case studies of different attacks
* Technical descriptions of different attacks

## Security policy
Security policy is a set of steps you can take to manage risks in a network to protect a business from threats and risk. This is a type of risk management
  
A security policy in the sense of this unit is a high level approach. 
>"what is it that we want to do to secure this organization?"
* What are the goals of the business and company?
* what are their priorities?
* Whats most important to the company?
* What are the risks and threats
* What is the environment like internally and externally?


## Implementing security policy
How are we going to implement these policies?

### Technologies
Implementing security policy through technologies will be the main focus of this unit
  * Understating what these technologies are capable of. what they are used for. Pros and Cons
  *  Firewalls, VPNs, IDS, and IPS, PKI, Access control, intrusion detection, intrusion detection, DDOS, wireless

### Other ways of implementing security policy 
* **Soft skills:** checking someones references
* **Risk transfer:** paying insurance to another company

## Security protocols
* What protocols do the technologies that we use operate on.
* Access Control uses: radius, kerberos
* VPNs: IPSEC, openssl
* Anomaly detection: SYN cookies, traceback

## Cryptography
* Understanding symmetric and asymmetric key crypto
* Anomaly detection (recurrence quantification analysis)

## Cloud and IOT security
To cover later

## DDOS
To cover later

## Wireless Security
* Low resource consumption crypto (elliptic curve cryptography)
* Cellular, WLAN, mesh network security
* RSA keys

# Assessments
Assessment will focus more on taking the small amounts of exposure to lots of different types of technologies so that you can relate that information to policy implementation.

## Group Project

>Follow a path. Whats important? what assets do they have? what matters to them? what the threats are to those assets? what is the likelihood that those assets could be damaged?

The project will be based on a given scenario.

Formulate policy. **OUTLINE** the implementation. **DONT** include router configs or firewall configs. **OUTLINE** **HOW** you will implement the policy.

### Steps for a successful project
* Analyse the assets of the organization
* Find the threats to it
* Do risk analysis
* Formulate policy
* Outline implementation

# Lab work
The lab works purpose is to *help* you implement security policy. not necessarily make you an expert on the topic.
Labs are worth 20% of the final mark
