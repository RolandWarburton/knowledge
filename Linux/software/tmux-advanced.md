## Hooks

Hooks are a great way for tmux to send data to other applications via stdout.

You can also use tmux hooks to *trigger* commands to tmux itself.

### Hooks Basics

Hooks can be defined in this format.
By default a hook will be scoped to the current session it is invoked in.

```bash
tmux set-hook <hook-name> command
```

When we define a hook its typical to use the `-g` flag.
This will allow the hook to run across all sessions.

```bash
tmux set-hook -g <hook-name> command
```

If you do not want to target all sessions,
you can also target the current session using the `-t` flag.

```bash
tmux set-hook -t <session-name> <hook-name> command
```

To see all your hooks you can run the following as required.

```bash
tmux show-hooks -t # for this session
tmux show-hooks -g # for all sessions
tmux show-hooks -w # window hooks for this session
tmux show-hooks -gw # window hooks for all sessions
```

### Track Pane Visit History

Ensure focus events are enabled in your `.tmux.conf`

```bash
set -g focus-events on
```

Each tmux pane has an index number that we can use to send commands to.
To find the index of the current pane run.

You may also need to find the pane_pid which
is the PID of the running processing inside a tmux pane.

```bash
tmux display-message -p "#{pane_index}"
tmux display-message -p "#{pane_pid}"

# find the PID of a pane_index
export target_pane_index=1
tmux list-panes -a -F '#{pane_index} #{pane_pid}' | grep "$target_pane_index " | cut -d ' ' -f2 
```

Consider this command which creates an event that runs each time you focus a new pane.

Note you can also access many other variables listed [here](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html).

```bash
tmux set-hook -g pane-focus-in "run-shell 'echo #{pane_index} > /home/roland/.tmux-pane-id'"
```

Lets improve this to keep only the last 10 pane_indexs in memory.

```bash
tmux set-hook -g pane-focus-in "run-shell '(P=\"$HOME/.tmux-pane-id\"; echo #{pane_index} >> \$P && tail -n 10 \$P > \$P.tmp && mv \$P.tmp \$P)'"
```

We can now track the last 10 panes we visited by their index, run this command in an open pane
and move between panes to see the pane indexes be pushed to the `.tmux-pane-id` file

### Toast Pane Index

This will flash on each tmux pane its index.

```bash
tmux display-pane
```

### Find Running Processes in Tmux Panes

For scripting purposes we may need to check what processes are running inside a tmux pane.
We can use a tool `pstree` for this.

First we need to find the pane PID, we can use the below to find the PID for a given index.

```bash
export pane_index="1"
tmux list-panes -a -F '#{pane_index} #{pane_pid}' | grep "$pane_index " | cut -d' ' -f 2
```

Then call `pstree` to see whats running under the parent process.

```bash
# 29212 is the PID
# -p show pids
# -A ascii output
pstree -pA 29212
```

An example of neovim.

```none
zsh(29212)â”€â”€â”€nvim(34028)â”€â”¬â”€nvim(34031)â”€â”¬â”€{nvim}(34032)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34034)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34038)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34100)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34101)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34102)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34103)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(34104)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(85658)
                         â”‚             â”œâ”€{nvim}(85824)
                         â”‚             â””â”€{nvim}(85893)
                         â”œâ”€{nvim}(34029)
                         â”œâ”€{nvim}(34030)
                         â””â”€{nvim}(34033)
```

An example of nothing running.

```none
zsh(32149)
```

You can check if things are running by scanning this output.

```bash
export pane_pid="29212"
if $(pstree -p "$pane_pid" | grep -qE 'nvim\([0-9+]\)'); then
  echo "neovim is running in this pane"
fi
```
