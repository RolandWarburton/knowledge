### Fix internet issues

You can review what network adaptors vmware will look for by running `/usr/bin/vmware-netcfg` and typing your password when prompted.

Make sure you have started the networking services.

```none
sudo systemctl start vmware-networks.service
sudo systemctl enable vmware-networks.service
```

Then "redetect" your network devices

```none
sudo modprobe vmnet && sudo vmware-networks --start
```
